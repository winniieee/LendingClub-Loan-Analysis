# LendingClub Loan Analysis

The LendingClub is a peer-to-peer lending company that directly connects borrowers and potential lenders/investors. In this notebook, I will build a classification model to predict whether or not a loan provided by LendingClub is likely to default. This project covers:

 - Use Pandas Dataframes to do feature engineering
 - Train a decision tree model to predict the sentiment of product reviews
 - Visualize the decision tree
 - Predict the probability of a certain label using the tree
 - Investigate how the complexity of the tree affects the results
